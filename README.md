# Face-products-Recommender-Sysyem
# problem statement:
Every one of us are using face products without knowing the skin type of our face which leads to dermal problems.
# Idea of approach:
Using deep learning model architectures and OpenCV techniques i have tried to recognize the skin type of face and recommending the face products based on there skin type.
# Accuracy of the model :
we have used around 260 images of two different classes of oily skin and normal skin each of 130 images and used DATA AUGUMANTATION and finally we reached an accuracy of 90% on real time face skin type recognization.
